## Usage

The webpage shows the 4 topics in boxes along with notes about each topic made by me as I went through the prework. If you open the developer tool to inspect the code, you can see the JavaScript running in the background. This tells, again, the 4 topics covered, and randomly generates a topic to prompt the user with what to study.
