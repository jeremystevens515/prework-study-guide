              <li>Internal Style Sheet: contains rules for style in the head section of the HTML file</li>
              <li>External Style Sheet: separate CSS file that is linked to the HTML file using a link element in the head section</li>

          <li>First, clone the remote repository onto your local machine</li>
          <li>Git flow starts with the main branch. The main branch is the master file of code for our website.</li>
          <li>To created a new branch:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>git checkout main</li>
              <li>git pull origin main</li>

          <li>To commit your changes to the remote working branch:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>git add -A</li>
              <li>git commit -m "write detailed message"</li>

              <li>git push origin feature/branch-name)</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Lastly, once you are confident in your new feature, submit a pull request for team members to review your work before merging
            the new feature into the main branch.</li>
          <li>It is best practice to delete feature branches once you are finished working in them.</li>
          <li>Always switch to and pull the latest version of the main branch to make sure you are up to date with 
            git checkout main and then git pull origin main</li>
