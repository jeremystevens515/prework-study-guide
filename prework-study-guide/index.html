          <li>In order to work on a separate part of the project, or feature,
            first create a new branch in the repository. This allows you to work on the code without interfering with others.</li>
          <li>Once changes are made on the local machine, commit those changes with a detailed message to the remote feature branch.
            Before you do this, be sure to pull the most recent version of the main branch so that there are no conflicts
            in case the code was updated while you were working.</li>
          <li>Lastly, once you are confident in your new feature, submit a pull request for team members to review your work before merging
            the new feature into the main branch.</li>
